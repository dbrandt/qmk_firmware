# Boardwalk in Swenglish

This keymap reimplements the default Boardwalk US keymap on top of the Swedish PRO Mac
keymap but with some programmer-centric twists. The Swedish letters are hidden behind 
Tap Dance double-taps of A, E and O.

As it's based off of the Swedish PRO Mac keymap (I use my Boardwalk on Mac and Linux),
pick that in your OS for the intended result.
